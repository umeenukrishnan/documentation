# _Doc

This directory will contain the documentation for the package. This will be automatically generated from python files through Sphinx documentation tool.

**Note:** Please read this document in GitHub or markdown editor like Typora.

## What is Sphinx?

Well, As mentioned earlier, It is a python project documentation tool. It reads the docstrings in python code and converts  them in to easily readable html format. Sphinx is also capable of converting the documentation into LaTeX format(PDF). The underlaying file format in this documentation is reStructuredText (RST) format, which is a markup language. It is necessary to write proper sphinx-readable docstrings to generate better documentation. See the files in  `_rsc` directory for standard docstring format.

#### reStructuredText:

It is generally uses for textual data in the python documentation. It has it own syntax to define headings, subheadings, bold and italic letters, weblinks, and code blocks. This syntax will be read by sphinx engine and it regenerates beautiful web documents. 

It is important to follow correct syntax, indentation, and space between the commands in rst files and docstrings. There are few .rst files in this directory so please feel free to have a glance at the syntax. After making the web documentation out of this files, you will understand how to use them for your own projects.

## Sphinx installation:

If Sphinx haven't installed in your system, follow this commands to install it and its supporting modules.

#### Installation in windows:

Open command prompt as administrator and use below command to install sphinx in your machine.

```
 pip install -U sphinx
```

 `sphinx-build --version` Use this command to check sphinx version.

Sphinx offers flexibility in changing the webpage format.  *read_docs*  is the most popular theme. In order to install it use this command  `pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`.

So far, we installed all the required modules that necessary to develop documentation.

## Documentation:

* Since the current projects has already dedicated this folder(_doc) for the documentation, open this directory in file explorer and open command prompt. 

* `sphinx-quickstart` use this command to start the documentation.

  * Procced with default options and provide information such as 
    * project name
    * author name
    * release version

*  It will create few file and folder in this directory. 

* Now, we have to modify `conf.py` file according to the our project file structure. 

* Open `conf.py`

  * Uncomment the lines 13th-15th and replace the line 15th with this code `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../_src'))`. 
  * Add `'sphinx.ext.autodoc'` in the extension list (line no. 33).
  * Also, change html theme from `'alabaster'` to `'sphinx_rtd_theme'`  (line no. 50).

* Lets go back to the command prompt.  Use  ` sphinx-apidoc -o . ../_src` to generate `.rst` for source code in *_src* folder. This command reads the *.py* files in *_src* directory and creates relevant `.rst` files in current working directory.

* Above command creates multiple `.rst` file along with `index.rst` and `modules.rst`

* `index.rst` file defines the contents of developed web-page. we have to add few details to this file so open `index.rst`  and update the file with below content.

* ```
  Project_name Documentation
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
  Write Project description here.
  
  This documentation is organized into a couple sections:
  
  * :ref:`intro`
  * :ref:`install`
  * :ref:`modules`
  
  .. _intro:
  
  .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 2
     :caption: Introduction:
  
     1_introduction
     2_contact
     
  .. _install:
  
  .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 2
     :caption: Installation:
  
     3_install
  
  .. _modules:
  
  .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 2
     :caption: Modules:  
  
     modules
  
  Indices and tables
  ==================
  
  * :ref:`genindex`
  * :ref:`modindex`
  * :ref:`search`
  
  ```

* Please don't mind this syntax. You get complete idea of it, after generating the final web documentation.

### Generating HTML files in local directory

* This process generates the html files in *_build/html* directory. These HTML files are capable of generating website locally.
* In command prompt use command, `make html` . This creates multiple html files in *_build/html* directory if the docstrings and `.rst` file are in correct format. Otherwise, it returns error in command prompt.
* After executing all the commands correctly, Open *index.html* in *_build/html* directory to see the project documentation.
* These files are not necessary to make online available website. Sphinx's has an other way to generate online website of the project so It is  better to add *_build* directory to *gitignore* list. 

### Publishing the website:

* After making all the necessary modifications to the *.rst* files. We can commit and push all the generated files to GitHub. To publish the projects *.rst* as website, please create an account in [Read the docs web](https://readthedocs.org/), if you haven't have one already. 
* Log-in to the website and direct to [rtd_projects](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/) then `Import a project` > `Import manually`. 
* Provide the information like Name, Repository URL, Repository type, and default branch.
  * Please note that the project name should be unique.
* You can check or uncheck the advanced options box. If have checked it, press `next` and provide necessary information and press `finish`. if haven't checked the advanced options box, pressing `next` directs to final page. In this page, press `Build version` to build the project website. It takes a moment to complete and generate website link as *view doc* in the same page.
* There you go!! By pressing *view doc* we can see the beautiful web page of the project.
* Any changes that are being made to *.rst* and docstring in *.py* files will reflect in website only after rebuilding in [rtd_projects](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/).

## Final notes:

The above mentioned procedure is best suitable for the file structure of this project. To develop the documentation of different type of file structure, few modifications need to be added to *conf.py* and *index.rst*  based on the respective file structure. 

To learn reStructuredText formatting, read the .rst files in projects like NURBS-Pytohn, 

#### Existing file description:

* `1_introduction.rst` :  contains the information of the project
* `2_contact.rst`: Contact information of contributors.
* `3_install.rst` : Package installation procedure.
